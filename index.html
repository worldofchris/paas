<h1>Get it here!</h1>

<p>
Not <i>it</i> that is, but rather...puns!
Give us a subject and we'll give you a pun
</p>

<h3>Try it now...</h3>

<div class="panel-body">
  <form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search">
    <div class="form-group">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="eggs">
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Pun Please</button>
  </form>
</div>

<h1>REST API</h1>
<p>
Of course, if it's SaaS it's all about teh API.  
</p>
<p>
Simply ask for a pun on any given subject, for example eggs:
</p>

<h2>dadjokes.org/pun/eggs</h2>

<p>
And you'll get back a Dad Jokes quality pun:
</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-body">
    That's eggcellent!
  </div>
</div>

<p>
I know it is!
</p>

<h3>Want some JSON with that sir?</h3>

<p>
But we don't just has text, need puns in your apps? REST easy, you'll be the <a href="json-king">JSON King</a> with our JavaScipts flavour response
</p>

<h2>dadjokes.org/pun/eggs/json</h2>
<p>
Yields:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{
    "subject": "eggs",
    "pun": "That's eggcellent!"
}
</pre>

<h1>What if we don't has it?</h1>
<p>
Say you want a pun for say, goats, but we haven't thought of one one yet?

Don't worry, take a ticket and we'll let you know when your pun is ready...
